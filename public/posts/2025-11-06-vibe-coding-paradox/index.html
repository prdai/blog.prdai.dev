    <h1>vibe-coding-paradox</h1>

    

    <p>yo, so this is basically a bunch of thoughts i&rsquo;ve had about vibe coding and generative ai that have been bouncing around in my head for a while. i asked claude to structure this properly so it&rsquo;s actually readable, but these are my genuine thoughts on the whole thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-days">the old days</h2>
<p>i started programming around 2019, maybe 2020. back then, there were no ai tools whatsoever - completely different time.</p>
<p>i used to work with flask a lot. knew pretty much every single error by heart because i&rsquo;d seen them all a hundred times. stack overflow was my home. i&rsquo;d spend hours and hours troubleshooting a single bug, going through random articles, github issues, even hitting page 2 of google.</p>
<p>and when you finally solved it? that feeling was incredible. unbelievable. there was something deeply satisfying about wrapping your head around why something wasn&rsquo;t working, then finally cracking it after hours of struggle.</p>
<h2 id="enter-chatgpt">enter chatgpt</h2>
<p>got introduced to generative ai in april 2024 through chatgpt. i&rsquo;d actually refused to use it before that. but then i was working with a friend who was using it, and it felt like so much power.</p>
<p>it could fix problems so fucking fast. faster than i ever could. we finished that project in record time.</p>
<p>few months later, started using github copilot through their student program. even crazier. the fact that it could write code in my codebase, understand different files, context-switch between them - felt like the next big thing. i remember being obsessed with their update logs, checking what new features they&rsquo;d pushed.</p>
<p>then a friend introduced me to claude code. started with claude pro, now i&rsquo;m on claude max. basically paying a fuck ton of money to llms at this point.</p>
<h2 id="but-heres-the-thing">but here&rsquo;s the thing</h2>
<p>i hate it.</p>
<p>weird part is, i&rsquo;m someone who&rsquo;s in this modern space but loves the old way things were done. going through random articles, diving deep into github issues, actually understanding what&rsquo;s happening under the hood.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier now, sure. get an error? ask chatgpt. fixed in seconds. but i learned so much more the hard way. that troubleshooting process, trying to wrap your head around why something isn&rsquo;t working - that&rsquo;s where real understanding came from.</p>
<h2 id="the-productivity-thing">the productivity thing</h2>
<p>from a productivity perspective, i get it. the gains are insane. i believe in that. but from a developer perspective - someone who&rsquo;s passionate about code, who cares about understanding it - vibe coding isn&rsquo;t it. at least not for me.</p>
<p>claude code is at a point where i can tell it to get details from the database, publish an event with that id, set up a listener for the new feature, and boom - it&rsquo;s done. no testing needed. (obviously you should always test, i&rsquo;m just showing how powerful these tools have become.)</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get a ticket done super fast now. but what&rsquo;s the point? there&rsquo;s no satisfaction in it. every time i open claude code, i want to use it less, but i&rsquo;m trapped because it makes me unbelievably productive.</p>
<h2 id="the-anyone-can-code-thing">the &ldquo;anyone can code&rdquo; thing</h2>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea that anyone can vibe code now. but there are levels to this.</p>
<p>your years of experience, your understanding of systems - that changes everything about how you use these tools. that&rsquo;s why i call bullshit on business owners thinking they can build entire applications through ai without any technical knowledge. even the best business person needs someone technical who actually understands what&rsquo;s happening under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">the future</h2>
<p>what happens long-term?</p>
<p>most university students right now (including me) are using generative ai to write their code. when the pre-chatgpt generation leaves the industry, we&rsquo;ll be left with a workforce that&rsquo;s heavily reliant on these tools. sure, some will use ai for productivity while maintaining deep knowledge, but how many?</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re heading toward a really different, dynamic workspace. interesting, but we don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;ll play out.</p>
<h2 id="my-personal-struggle">my personal struggle</h2>
<p>i&rsquo;ve become too reliant on these tools.</p>
<p>my rule is: if i can&rsquo;t instruct the ai step by step, if i don&rsquo;t have a mental map of what needs to be done, then i don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s happening. that&rsquo;s my bare minimum - i need to understand enough to prompt properly, to go in-depth about what i want.</p>
<p>my end goal? stop using ai tools completely. which i know is probably impossible at this point. even this article - i&rsquo;m dumping my thoughts to claude and asking it to structure them properly so humans can actually read it.</p>
<h2 id="the-grunt-work-question">the grunt work question</h2>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just grunt work that i&rsquo;m giving to these llms, if it&rsquo;s that basic, that low-level - why don&rsquo;t i just do it myself? how hard can it be?</p>
<p>but i still use them. to keep up. to do more. it&rsquo;s a weird time.</p>
<h2 id="where-im-at-now">where i&rsquo;m at now</h2>
<p>i&rsquo;ve reduced my usage a lot compared to before, and i&rsquo;ll continue to. want to get to a point where i&rsquo;m not heavily reliant on ai, even for basic shit.</p>
<p>i love coding, man. but all of this has made me view it on a task basis - let&rsquo;s get this done, let&rsquo;s get that done - without the actual satisfaction that i originally signed up for.</p>
<p>for someone who cares more about programming itself than what can be done with it (i know, crazy statement), vibe coding is the antithesis of everything i love about this field.</p>
<p>but here i am, still using it. still paying for it. still hating every second of it.</p>
