most people haven&rsquo;t. and that&rsquo;s the thing i&rsquo;ve been realizing.
the obsession
when i started getting serious about programming, i somehow convinced myself that the solution to not knowing things was simple: memorize everything. every parameter, every function, every bit of syntax. if i knew it all, the gap would close.">

    <h1>accepting that you wont know it all</h1>

    

    <p>have you ever actually sat down and configured your tsconfig.json? like really configured it, understood each option? or looked through your package-lock.json and understood why it&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>most people haven&rsquo;t. and that&rsquo;s the thing i&rsquo;ve been realizing.</p>
<h2 id="the-obsession">the obsession</h2>
<p>when i started getting serious about programming, i somehow convinced myself that the solution to not knowing things was simple: memorize everything. every parameter, every function, every bit of syntax. if i knew it all, the gap would close.</p>
<p>so i made a to-do list. every single day: make a CNN, make an RNN, make an LSTM. find random datasets on kaggle, rewrite the same code over and over. months of this. most of my day gone just rewriting neural networks i&rsquo;d already memorized.</p>
<p>it was pointless. looking back, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>but at the time it felt necessary. like if i didn&rsquo;t know something completely, i didn&rsquo;t know it at all. there was no middle ground. so i kept grinding. tkinter, websockets — i wanted to learn all of it. deeply. completely. i was obsessed with the idea that i could just absorb an entire package through repetition and memorization.</p>
<p>it never ends though. there&rsquo;s always another parameter, another edge case, another thing you haven&rsquo;t tried.</p>
<h2 id="when-syntax-mattered-less">when syntax mattered less</h2>
<p>at some point i realized the syntax wasn&rsquo;t the important part. it was the concepts underneath. the theory. the why things work the way they do. that actually stuck.</p>
<p>and that helped. but it also opened up another problem: there&rsquo;s so much abstraction everywhere. at one point i was like, i don&rsquo;t need math, i can just do ai with code. wrong again. i took some courses on coursera but they never clicked because i wasn&rsquo;t grounded in the math. now when i see equations in research papers i still have to ask chatgpt what they mean.</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the other languages. rust, go. been learning both slowly on the side forever. still have to think about how to handle results in rust. don&rsquo;t know the folder structure conventions. still get frustrated when something doesn&rsquo;t click immediately.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-problem">the real problem</h2>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i think happened: i built this habit early on. the habit of needing to know everything before moving forward. the habit of treating partial knowledge like failure.</p>
<p>and that habit is still there. when i don&rsquo;t know something, there&rsquo;s this immediate reaction to just&hellip; go back to what i&rsquo;m comfortable with. avoid the gap. pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>which is backwards, obviously. but it&rsquo;s a hard habit to break.</p>
<h2 id="what-actually-changed-things">what actually changed things</h2>
<p>somewhere along the way i started thinking about it differently. not about knowing everything, but about learning when you need to learn. the primeagen talks about this — you don&rsquo;t learn a language, you build something and use the language. you learn what&rsquo;s required to make that thing happen.</p>
<p>and that framework actually works. it cuts through the endless memorization. it stops the side quests. you build something, you learn what you need, you move on.</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a tension there. if you only learn what&rsquo;s strictly necessary, are you really understanding? or are you just copying code?</p>
<p>i think the answer is: both? when you&rsquo;re doing a project and you hit something you don&rsquo;t understand, that&rsquo;s the moment to dig. not before. because then it has context. then it actually sticks.</p>
<p>but you also have to accept that some things will stay unexplained. some depths you won&rsquo;t reach. and that&rsquo;s just part of it.</p>
<h2 id="where-this-leaves-me">where this leaves me</h2>
<p>i&rsquo;m still learning rust. still sometimes frustrated. still missing math knowledge i wish i had. still retreat to comfortable territory sometimes instead of pushing forward.</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m also getting better at being honest about gaps. at being okay with learning something just enough to ship it. at understanding that nobody really knows what they&rsquo;re doing, they&rsquo;re just better at working despite not knowing.</p>
<p>the obsession habit is still there though. that need to go deep on everything. it&rsquo;s something i&rsquo;m trying to accept i can&rsquo;t do. not because i don&rsquo;t want to, but because it&rsquo;s just not realistic. there&rsquo;s too much. too many angles. too many things.</p>
<p>so the goal isn&rsquo;t to know it all. it&rsquo;s to stop expecting yourself to. to break the habit of treating not knowing like failure.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the part i&rsquo;m still working on. :)</p>
